## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
### My favorite apps:
- PUBG Mobile: Great battle royal game, great graphics, can play with teammates and have live conversation
- Reddit: Can read and post insights on various topics anonymously, great UI, I really like the subreddits concept
- Discord: Servers and Channels, UI, very straightforward concept but very useful tool

### I would like to build...
An app that tracks stress levels. Every time someone logs into their phone, it would take a snapshot of their eyes using the front camera, and use machine learning models to determine stress levels by analyzing eyelids, dark circles and other eye-related features by comparing them with data already available. It would track stress levels over a period of time and send out reminders to pause using phone, or make some other plan to reduce stress levels, like sleeping more etc...

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
